A seed can be disperse 1 position to left and 1 position to right and to the current position at each second. Find the minimum time(seconds) at which the seeds are dispersed at all positions in the garden.
Sample input:

7 (size of the garden) 
3 (no of seeds) 
1 5 6 (seeds position) 
5 (size of the garden)
